I need your help to evaluate the performance of several models in the speech interaction scenario. The models will receive a speech input from the user, which they need to understand and respond to with a speech output.
Your task is to rate the model’s responses based on the provided user input transcription [Instruction] and the model’s output transcription [Response].

Please evaluate the response on a scale of 1 to 5:
1 point: The response is largely irrelevant, incorrect, or fails to address the user’s query. It may be off-topic or provide incorrect information.
2 points: The response is somewhat relevant but lacks accuracy or completeness. It may only partially answer the user’s question or include extraneous information.
3 points: The response is relevant and mostly accurate, but it may lack conciseness or include unnecessary details that don’t contribute to the main point.
4 points: The response is relevant, accurate, and concise, providing a clear answer to the user’s question without unnecessary elaboration.
5 points: The response is exceptionally relevant, accurate, and to the point. It directly addresses the user’s query in a highly effective and efficient manner, providing exactly the information needed.

Below are the transcription of user’s instruction and models’ response:
### [Instruction]: {question}
### [Response]: {response}

After evaluating, please output the score only without anything else.
You don’t need to provide any explanations.
